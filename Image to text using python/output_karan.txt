Methods: Review of existing and commercially available vision assistive devices has been done.
Comparison is based on feedback mechanics, adaptability in the surrounding environment, and function- AE itive devices visually

Results: The findings from this study suggest that a few assistive devices are available commercially. The

commercially available assistive devices influenced by the mindsets of visually impaired and economical

benefits. A combination of several devices can be fruitful in eliminating the limitation of an available

device. Ample researches have been done for navigation, communication, object detection, and object

recognition to assist visual impaired. The primary results might be promising, but most studies are not

tested in actual conditions.

Conclusion: Various assistive devices for visually impaired are available commercially and several studies

indicate further advancement. However, adaptability and trustworthiness are major issues. The primary

reason behind this is the low-performance level of the device, feedback, and testing. The secondary rea-

son is commercial availability and poor knowledge of the end-user.

  

> IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION

Advancement in computer science and image processing has paved the way to assist sensory
impaired in doing various activities.

© Assistive technologies play a pivotal role in daily activities of visually impaired by assisting them for

communication, and mobility.

Assistive technologies can lead visually impaired to make them self-sustained.

Very few research and devices related to assistive technology had reached the stage of testing and

commercialization.

© Researchers can utilize the study in providing better assistive technology for the visually impaired.
